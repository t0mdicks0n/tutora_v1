        "body": "There are three parts to my question. Part one: Let's assume we have a reversible reaction at equilibrium as follows : Calcium carbonate (solid) goes into calcium oxide(solid) and carbon dioxide(gas). Let's assume that I add more calcium carbonate i.e I add more solid. Now I understand that there would be no shift in the position of the equilibrium since we added a solid therefore we induced a very negligible change in concentration , but what I am confused about is doesn't more reactant mean more product and doesn't more product symbolise a shift to the right? Part two: -I have read that the equilibrium constant KcKc and KpKp are really just close approximations of the true thermodynamic constant which uses activities hence the activity of a solid and pure liquid is always 1. However upon further research I discovered that for an esterification reaction the equilibrium constant is 4 -First of all, the above reaction involves all pure liquids and hence the thermodynamic equilibrium constant would be one ,however why stick to a value of 4 why not easily say it is one since all activities are 1. Part 3 -If we do take pure liquids in the KcKc value how do you measure the concentration of such a species, wouldn't the value be very high.My intution tells me that pure liquids are only taken when a reaction only involves pure liquids only , but they are not taken in heterogeneous reactions or when the liquid involved acts as a solvent as well.However in a case of a heterogeneous reaction only involving solids and liquids what will your equilibrium constant look like . Lastly I have no knowledge of thermodynamics and I am still a high school student .",
